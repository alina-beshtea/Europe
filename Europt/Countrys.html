      <p>Europe is a continent located entirely in the <em>Northern Hemisphere</em> and
        mostly in the <em>Eastern Hemisphere</em>. It is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to
        the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, Asia to the east, and the
        Mediterranean Sea to the south. It comprises the westernmost part of
         Eurasia. </p>

      <p>There are 44 countries in Europe. A few of them are transcontinental,
         meaning they are considered to be a part of both Europe and Asia.
          Some dependencies and territories are also part of Europe such as the
          Aland Islands, two constituent countries of Denmark, British Overseas
           Territories, and Svalbard. 28 countries of Europe are members of the
            European Union (EU). Europe is bdivided into four main regions:
            Southern, Northern, Eastern, and Western Europe</p>
